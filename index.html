      <p>
        Afang soup is fast climbing the top of the list of popular Nigerian
        soup. If you are interested in exploring Nigerian foods, this delicious
        soup would definitely spur your interest in Nigerian foods. This
        delicious soup is native to the Efiks, the major occupant of (Cross
        River & Akwa Ibom State). It really doesn’t matter your language,
        background or ethnic group, you can try original foods from different
        Nigerian cultures and ethnicity. Over the last few months I have focused
        on Efik delicacies, afang sits right on top of the list and today we are
        going to learn how to make this soup and other delicious Efik/Calabar
        foods. I think After Igbo, Hausa, and Yoruba; Efik is another popular
        group in Nigeria; they have delicious foods that have left the rest of
        us salivating. Apart from this soup, they also have Edikang-Ikong,
        atama, nsala, and a few other delicious soups.

    <section>
      <h3>Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em
            >The Afang (Ukazi) leaves are tough, so they must be pounded or
            blended into a fine consistency (usually with a food processor and
            minimal water) to soften them before adding to the pot. Sellers at
            African markets often offer a grinding service.</em
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <em
            >Waterleaf releases a lot of water as it cooks. After slicing and
            washing, drain it thoroughly in a sieve and squeeze out as much
            excess water as possible to avoid a watery soup.</em
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <em
            >Assorted meats (beef, goat meat, cow skin/pomo, tripe, etc.) and
            fish (stockfish, smoked fish, periwinkles, snails) add depth of
            flavor. Cook these proteins until tender on their own, using minimal
            water, and reserve the flavorful stock.</em
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <em
            >Wash periwinkles with lime juice or grape juice to remove all
            slime, and soak/clean dried fish in hot water to remove bones and
            dirt.</em
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <em
            >Afang soup is known for its rich, palm oil base. Ensure you use a
            good amount of palm oil to get the authentic taste and color, adding
            it before the vegetables.</em
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <em
            >he key to a vibrant, fresh-looking Afang soup is to cook the
            vegetables for only a short time. Add the waterleaf first, let it
            simmer for a few minutes, then add the pre-pounded Afang leaves and
            cook for just 2-5 minutes more before turning off the heat.</em
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <em
            >Some cooks suggest not covering the pot when initially cooking the
            waterleaf to let excess water evaporate and to help it retain its
            fresh color.</em
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <em
            >Continuously taste and adjust the seasoning (salt, pepper, crayfish
            powder) throughout the process to achieve a balanced flavor
            profile.</em
